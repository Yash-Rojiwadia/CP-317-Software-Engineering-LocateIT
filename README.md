# LocateIT

LocateIT is a mobile application available for both Android and iOS, which helps users locate restaurants, attractions, and other entertainment activities in their area. The app provides a search bar that enables users to look for a specific type of destination. Additionally, users can filter the results based on distance, price, and ratings.

One of the unique features of the app is that users can add destinations to their favorites list. This allows other users to view and explore the recommended destinations. Once a user visits a destination, they can create a text entry about their experience to save it as a memorable experience.
